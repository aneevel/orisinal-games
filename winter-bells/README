### WINTERBELLS ###

See http://www.ferryhalim.com/orisinal/g3/bells.htm for more details.

My attempt to recreate the above orisinal game, Bells (or, as some might say,
Winterbells). My goal is to be as faithful to the original as possible, so this
project will last as long as I feel there is some difference between the two.

One point of difference is assets used; I will not use the same art assets as
the original. I see no benefit in using the original assets, and since I also
intend to improve my art skills, this is a nice excuse to quickly make some
simple assets.
