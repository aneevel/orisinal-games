First step is constructing a base window. For this step, no logic is
necessary; just create a 800 x 600 window for now.

Now would be a good time to start displaying some graphics - we don't
have anything on screen yet.

A natural place to start is loading the initial background. I won't worry
about a menu for now, I just want to get into the game. In the original game,
you are a rabbit in a snow-covered landscape with trees in the background.
Snow is falling from the sky. I won't deal with that yet, but I do want to
choose a background where I can replicate something similar. My choice will
be a forest background, so I can replace all the major graphical elements
of the original game. The background will be trees with a dark night above.
The rabbit will be replaced by a squirrel, which is anatomically similar (eases
drawing). The snow particles will be replaced by small leaves, and the bells
will be replaced by acorns.

For now, I should create a simple 800 x 600 background to display at the beginning.
