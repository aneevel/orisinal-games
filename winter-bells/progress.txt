First step is constructing a base window. For this step, no logic is
necessary; just create a 800 x 600 window for now.

Now would be a good time to start displaying some graphics - we don't
have anything on screen yet.

A natural place to start is loading the initial background. I won't worry
about a menu for now, I just want to get into the game. In the original game,
you are a rabbit in a snow-covered landscape with trees in the background.
Snow is falling from the sky. I won't deal with that yet, but I do want to
choose a background where I can replicate something similar. My choice will
be a forest background, so I can replace all the major graphical elements
of the original game. The background will be trees with a dark night above.
The rabbit will be replaced by a squirrel, which is anatomically similar (eases
drawing). The snow particles will be replaced by small leaves, and the bells
will be replaced by acorns.

For now, I should create a simple 800 x 600 background to display at the beginning.

### 5:07 PM ###

I've created a background for use. It is located in the asset folder, where
all graphics will end up. There's no issue loading this background, though
I dislike how it looks right now. I'll wait to add any polish to the background.

Next up is creating a moveable sprite. As previously established, the player
is a squirrel. I will insert the playable squirrel at the bottom of the frame,
with only one animation. This squirrel will need to move along with the mouse,
so the SFML Event section will need to be thoroughly understand to implement
movement.
